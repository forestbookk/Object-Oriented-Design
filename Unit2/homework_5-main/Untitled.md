Quotations are recommended to prevent plagiarism, which is a concern due to copyright's role in driving innovation. Regulations exist to deter individuals from copying others' ideas across various mediums. Severe consequences await those caught plagiarizing, such as lower grade, and failure in course. While paraphrasing is suggested, sometimes direct quotation preserves the essence best.

Numerous tools automate citation, and writing centers offer guidance on citation protocols. Proper quotation involves enclosing excerpts within quotation marks and reviewing the balance of quotations post-writing.

Effective quoting practices include avoiding excessive quotations without original analysis ("Citation Salad"). Adding personal commentary with each quotation and providing context helps mitigate abrupt quotations ("Plop"). The "quotation sandwich" method integrates quotations smoothly within the text, ensuring coherence.



Quotations are suggested when people are facing the risk of plagiarism. As copyright can encourage people to create new things and thus help society make progress, there are some rules set to stop people from copy the words or ideas from others in various aspects, such as books, movies, music, image, artworks, softwares and architecture.
With those rules, in many places such as workplaces and schools, people can get heavily punished if they plagiarize. For example, in Harvard students who plagiarize may be failed or even spelled from school. To express someone else's ideas but not plagiarizing, some people suggest paraphrasing. But when paraphrasing is hard to express the essence, quotations is the right thing to do. 
Nowadays, there have been already some tools to make citation easier, for example, some tools can automatically create citations and make them into a list. There are also writing centers where students can learn about citation rules. In addition, it is considered a good idea to read published papers to know about when and how a quotation should be added.
To quote, one should use quotation marks before and after the sentence. After the paper is finished, one can search on the Internet to know whether there are too much quotations inside it. Additionally, people can also read out load to see if it is easy to understand.
From the third video clip, I learned about some tips when quoting. Initially, we should avoid "Citation Salad", which means that use too much quotations in a paragraph without any words of our own. To fix the problem, we can make some comments of each quotations using our own words, so that we can show our opinions. In addition, "Plop" quotations should be avoided, which means quotations pop out from nowhere without any explanations in advance and after. The solution is to add some background information of the quotation, such as its author and publish time, as well as some analysis of it. What's more, a method to adequately frame quotations is suggested--using "quotation sandwich", "wLilyTong:
"with the statement introducing it serving as the top slice of bread and the explanation following it serving as the bottom slice". With this approach, we can make our quotations more natural and fluent.
